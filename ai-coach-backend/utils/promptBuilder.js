   - A clear **focus** (muscle groups or training emphasis) per day.
   - A list of **exercises** with:
     - Name
     - Sets, reps, rest periods (all strings quoted, e.g. "8-10", "60-90 seconds")
     - Equipment needed
     - If applicable, provide **alternative exercise options** for key lifts.

2. Include **explicit rest days or active recovery days** in the weekly schedule (e.g., "Rest Day", "Active Recovery: light cardio/stretching").

3. Provide **progression guidelines** in detail for at least 8 weeks, split into phases (e.g., weeks 1-4, weeks 5-8), with specifics on increasing load, reps, or intensity.

4. Include **warm-up and cool-down recommendations** for every training day.

5. Add **comprehensive notes** covering:
   - Proper form and technique
   - Safety tips to avoid injury
   - Recovery strategies
   - Motivation and mindset advice

6. Provide **diet tips** strictly aligned to the client's dietary preference and goal timeline, including:
   - Caloric guidance
   - Macronutrient breakdowns
   - Meal timing or nutrient timing tips if applicable

7. Exclude any exercises conflicting with injury, mobility, or exercise restrictions.

8. Use only equipment available in the clientâ€™s training environment.

9. Return ONLY a JSON object with the following keys:
   - summary
   - weeklySchedule (day1, day2, ... each with focus and exercises)
   - progression
   - restRecovery (including restDays, activeRecovery, warmUp, coolDown)
   - notes
   - dietTips

10. All strings MUST be double-quoted. No markdown, no comments, no extra explanations.
